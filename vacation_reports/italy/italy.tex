\section{Introduction and general considerations}
\subsection{Time considerations}
Italy is a quite varied country. While the overall culture, climate, flora and fauna is relatively similar, there are still regional differences across Italy. 
The south is usually hotter than the north and is more known for its beaches. However, the regions differ most noticeably in their food specialities.
This can be seen for example when thinking about pasta dishes. There is tagliatelle al ragú in Bologna, lasagna from Emilia-Romagna, sphaghetti or mezze maniche alla carbonara in Roma and pasta alla norma in Sicily.

\subsection{Flora and fauna}
Italy being a mediterranean country generally is warmer than the rest of europe. The farther south you go, the hotter it gets. The flora can vary quite a bit, going from chestnut trees, oaks and beaches in the more mountainous regions even to palms near the sea side.
Although larger mammals like bears can be found in the alps, the fauna is dominated by small animals and marine life (when near the sea).

\subsection{Food and drinks to look out for}
Food:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item Pizza napoletana
	\item Many variants of pasta dishes such as carbonara, pasta al ragú or pasta alla norma
	\item Granita (especially with fresh brioche)
	\item Sea food when close to the sea
	\item Cannolo when in the south
	\item Gelato
	\item Tiramisú
\end{itemize}
Drinks:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item Aperol Spritz
	\item Regional wines
	\item Prosecco
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Financial considerations}
The flight to Italy is relatively cheap (usually less than 200€), the food is cheaper in the south than the north but generally still quite affordable and accomodation is getting more expensive. A good pizza can already be bought for 5€ during lunch and 10€ for dinner in a restaurant. Sea food in general is more expensive (can be easily 25€ per person).
\section{Sicily}
\subsection{General information}
Sicily is an island in the south of Italy which in ancient times has a history of both Greeks and Romans. As such it has a lost of ruins of both Greek and Roman origins. The local dialect differs quite strongly from regular Italian, although this is also spoken and understood. In Sicily the mafia still has a relatively strong influence. Although it is rarely an issue, you should at least not mock the mafia.

Things to do or visit while in Sicily:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item Valle dei templi (close to Agrigento; ruins of Greek temples)
	\item Giardino della Kolymbethra (close to Agrigento; botanical garden with lots and lots of citrus fruits)
	\item Villa Romana del Casale (close to Piazza Armerina; a Villa that's left from Roman times)
	\item Agrigento 
	\item Siracusa
	\item Noto (UNESCO World heritage town with a beautiful church)
	\item Etna
	\item Taormina
\end{itemize}
If you want to visit multiple locations in Sicily, it is highly recommended to rent a car to be free to drive around. Unless you want to stay at the beach I would recommend to visit multiple places and stay for a few days at each spot, depending on what you want to see and do.
\subsection{Our experience}
We flew to Catania and rented a car to do our tour of Sicily and visit multiple locations. We started our tour with a few days stop in Siracusa, a lovely city at the sea with a lovely greek old town. After a few days of enjoying the local food and granita, we drove to our next stop in Licata and vistied the historic city of Noto on the way. From Licata we did a day trip to the Valle dei templi, a historic site with ruins of Greek temples, and the adjecent Giardino della Kolymbethra, a botanical garden with lots of citrus fruits, and another day trip to the Villa Romana del Casale. After our stop in Licata, we made our way to the next stop in Riposto close to Taormina. Taormina is city in the hills of Sicily with beautiful buildings and a beautiful view towards Calabria from the ancient theater in town. Furthermore, you could visit Etna (which we didn't do due to the weather and time concerns) from this region and do e.g. hikes. If you decide to visit Etna, consider that it is a mountain and the temperatures can be drastically different both from the rest of Sicily and even between the foot of the vulcano and the top of it.

%We stayed in \href{https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/saikaew-resort.de.html?aid=318615&label=German_Switzerland_DE_CH_29561940745-4La_x1JtjPk4ljDcius9eQS640874808148\%3Apl\%3Ata\%3Ap1\%3Ap2\%3Aac\%3Aap\%3Aneg\%3Afi55583925958\%3Atidsa-302083110424\%3Alp1003277\%3Ali\%3Adec\%3Adm\%3Aag29561940745\%3Acmp313804345&sid=ef02e173088c39a4d4cfe3124886fffe&checkin=2023-10-21;checkout=2023-10-22;dest_id=-3247118;dest_type=city;dist=0;group_adults=4;group_children=0;hapos=1;hpos=1;no_rooms=2;req_adults=4;req_children=0;room1=A\%2CA;room2=A\%2CA;sb_price_type=total;soh=1;sr_order=popularity;srepoch=1691079435;srpvid=e10272814ca60095;type=total;ucfs=1&#no_availability_msg}{small lovely place} at the outskirts of the city (40min by foot to the city center). They have bikes you can use for free. With the hotel we booked a day tour to visit all the temples and the golden triangle and another one for trekking in the jungle.
%\subsection{Trekking in the jungle} 
%Trekking in the jungle was a special experience. Trekking in 30-35°C weather in the jungle with 90\%+ humidity is quite exhausting. The trek itself was not too technical though a sturdy pair of hiking boots is recommended. You should remember to bring mosquito repellent, sun screen as well as hats against the sun. Our guide cooked food in bamboo for lunch (chicken, omelette and rice) which is a unique experience.
%\subsection{Temple and golden triangle tour}
%The temple and golden triangle tour is a packed day (start around 8, finish around 19) but well worth it. We visited many different temples, the most impressive of which being the white temple; were brought to the monkey cave, where two rivaling gangs of monkeys live freely. Our guide fed them bringing them relatively close to our group, with no incident occuring. After a lunch break we drove to the Birma/Myanmar border and visited the golden triangle (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos), where we visited an opium museum. 
%\subsection{Chiang Rai city}
%In Chiang Rai there are some temples and restaurants with not too much to see. The night market was quite nice with lots of stand and street food. In Chiang Rai we have had Khantoke which is northern Thai dish the owners of Rebstock recommend us to try. It consists of lots of small dishes such as sausages as well as other kinds of meat and dips.

While it was quite rainy when we were there, it was still quite nice, due to the well furnished rooms and the nice hotel restaurant. In roughly 300m distance from the entrance there is also a small restaurant operated by two nice ladies. We can recommend this. Due to the relatively bad weather, we only stayed at the pool when it wasn't too rainy and didn't get to do an island tour. If we would have had the opportunity we would have gone for a tour to see different islands including Koh Phi Phi.

%\section{Venice}
%Bangkok is surprisingly large with lots of things to see and do. We initially planned only 2.5 days to see Bangkok but did not see everything there is to see. That said, 2.5 days is enough to get a rough understanding of Bangkok.
%From Bangkok you could do a one day trip to Ayutthaya which we meant to do but chose not to do in the end (quite exhausted at the end of the trip).

It was a nice experience though the shades do little against light in the morning and the rains can be quite loud.
%We have done two self organised trips to the \href{https://www.chatuchakmarket.org/}{Chatuchak weekend market} and to china town.
%\subsection{China Town}
%China town is quite expansive with lots and lots of small backstreets with stands. It is worth a trip as it has a quite distinct atmosphere and feels like you are in a different country. If you don't like small markets and strolling around, china town might not be for you.
%\subsection{Chatuchak weekend market}
%The Chatuchak weekend market is one of, if not the biggest weekend market in the world. According to their homepage there are 15000 stands and you need 3h to see a bit of everything and 5h if you want to actually try to haggle for stuff. We have spend roughly 4h on the market and feel like we saw roughly half of what is to see. It is a wet market, meaning there are live animals (dogs, cats, mice, hamster, snakes, spiders, chameleons, monkeys, ...) for sale. If you enjoy weekend markets it is well worth a trip!
%\section{Other things to see}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Ayutthaya
%	\item Sukhothai
%	\item Lots of islands
%	\item Isan
%	\item Phuket (known as the party province, roughly comparable to Mallorca)
%\end{itemize}
%There is likely way more to see, but I cannot remember them right now.
